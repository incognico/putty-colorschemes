Various color schemes for PuTTy and its forks
---------------------------------------------

The session the color schemes apply to is named "devnull", you can change the
session name be editing the corresponding `*.reg` file.

[`base.reg`](https://github.com/nwohlgem/putty-colorschemes/blob/master/base.reg) -- Backround-, foreground- and cursor-colors, nice to work with
 all of the color schemes

All other `*.reg` files are different color schemes.
